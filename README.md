# Simple Node.js Api Project

This is a simple practice project built with **pure Node.js** (no frameworks). It demonstrates:

- Creating basic HTTP APIs without using Express or other frameworks
- Handling CPU-intensive tasks using **Worker Threads** for better performance
- Reading and writing data using the **filesystem** (no database used)

The project is useful for learning how to:
- Build a Node.js server from scratch
- Manage CPU load efficiently with workers
- Work with file-based data storage

> ⚙️ No external database or third-party frameworks used.
